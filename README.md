# Midpoint Meetup Project

## Overview
Currently working on a project that came into fruition when I was trying to find a tool online where I could enter multiple addresses to find the latitude and longitude midpoint. However, everything online was either limited to only 2 addresses or had an archaic UI. I ended up using Excel to calculate the midpoint myself, which was obviously inefficient.

## Motivation
This led me to build **Midpoint Meetup**, a solution for quickly and efficiently finding a meeting point for multiple addresses. The project aims to create a more user-friendly interface and allow users to input multiple addresses without the limitations of existing tools.

## Status
**Midpoint Meetup** is currently in progress:
- The backend is mostly complete.
- Frontend development is underway.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Python
- **Frontend**: JavaScript/React deploying on Vercel
- **APIs**: Google Places API, Google Geocoding API

## Features
- Calculate the latitude and longitude midpoint of multiple addresses with Geocoding API
- Use Google Places API to suggest popular locations near the midpoint for easy meetups.

## Future Plans
- Complete the frontend to provide a sleek and intuitive user interface.
- Add more customization options for suggested meeting spots.

## Installation
Instructions for running the project locally will be added once development is further along.
